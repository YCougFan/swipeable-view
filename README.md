Playing around with swipeable views npm package here: https://github.com/oliviertassinari/react-swipeable-views

Couldn't get them to swipe and upon inspection discovered they would work when the enableMouseEvents prop on the
inspect page was set to true instead of false. After working with my mentor and a classmate, we set the code that way
and got it to swipe upon the click of the mouse. Probably will try to figure out how to install a button to help with
functionality for desktop view.
